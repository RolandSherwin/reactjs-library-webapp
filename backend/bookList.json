Unfortunately, her husband, Alfred, is losing his sanity to Parkinson's disease, and their children have long since flown the family nest to the catastrophes of their own lives. The oldest, Gary, a once-stable portfolio manager and family man, is trying to convince his wife and himself, despite clear signs to the contrary, that he is not clinically depressed. The middle child, Chip, has lost his seemingly secure academic job and is failing spectacularly at his new line of work. And Denise, the youngest, has escaped a disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man--or so her mother fears. Desperate for some pleasure to look forward to, Enid has set her heart on an elusive goal: bringing her family together for one last Christmas at home.\n\nStretching from the Midwest at mid-century to the Wall Street and Eastern Europe of today, The Corrections brings an old-fashioned world of civic virtue and sexual inhibitions into violent collision with the era of home surveillance, hands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental health care, and globalized greed. Richly realistic, darkly hilarious, deeply humane, it confirms Jonathan Franzen as one of our most brilliant interpreters of American society and the American soul.\n   (front flap)","workDescription":"Like bookends of the past half century, the two generations of the Lambert family represent two very different aspects of America. Alfred, the patriarch, is a distant, puritanical company man; he is also slipping into Parkinson's-induced dementia. His wife, Enid, is a model Midwestern housewife, at once deferential and controlling. Their three children--Gary, an uptight banker, baffled by his own persistent unhappiness; Chip, and ex-professor now failing as a screenwriter; and Denise, and up-and-coming chief in a hot new restaurant--have little time for Enid and Alfred. But when Enid calls for one last Christmas at the family home, the trajectories of five American lifetimes converge.\n\nWith this important, profoundly affecting work, Jonathan Franzen confirms his place in the top tier of American novelists. His unique blend of subversive humor and full-blooded realism makes The Corrections a grandly entertaining family saga.","subjects":["dementia","alcoholism","Protestantism","depression","corruption in Lituania","adultery","Christmas","Parent and adult child","Fiction","Married women","Married women in fiction","Parkinson's disease","Parkinson's disease in fiction","Middle West in fiction","Parent and adult child in fiction","National Book Award Winner","award:national_book_award=2001","award:national_book_award=fiction","New York Times bestseller","nyt:trade_fiction_paperback=2010-08-29","LGBT","Married women -- Fiction","Patients","Domestic fiction","Parkinson's disease -- Patients -- Fiction","Parent and adult child -- Fiction","Middle West -- Fiction","Older women","Families","Psychology","Christmas stories","Fiction, family life","Married people, fiction","Middle west, fiction","Large type books","Dysfunctional families","Social life and customs","Manners and customs","Mujeres casadas","Novela","Parálisis agitante","Pacientes","Padres e hijos","Fiction, family life, general"],"rating":"4.14","ratingCount":"7","image":{"name":"9273707-M.jpg","url":"https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9273707-M.jpg","path":"E:\\New-Folder-2\\Projects\\library-webapp-reactjs\\backend\\assets\\coverImages\\9273707-M.jpg"},"booksAvailable":3,"reservationQueue":[]},{"OLId":"OL47287W","title":"Red Harvest.","author":["Dashiell Hammett"],"year":"1974","description":"When the last honest citizen of Poisonville was murdered, the Continental Op stayed on to punish the guilty--even if that meant taking on an entire town.

Lord of the Flies remains as provocative today as when it was first published in 1954, igniting passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature. Though critically acclaimed, it was largely ignored upon its initial publication. Yet soon it became a cult favorite among both students and literary critics who compared it to J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye in its influence on modern thought and literature.

The book focuses on a group of British boys stranded on an uninhabited island and their disastrous attempt to govern themselves. Themes include the tension between groupthink and individuality, between rational and emotional reactions, and between morality and immorality.\n\nThe novel has been generally well received. It was named in the Modern Library 100 Best Novels, reaching number 41 on the editor's list, and 25 on the reader's list. In 2003 it was listed at number 70 on the BBC's The Big Read poll, and in 2005 Time magazine named it as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005. Time also included the novel in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time.
